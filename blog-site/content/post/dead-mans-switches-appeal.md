I am hoping to interview some investigative journalists for my masters thesis at the University of Oxford.

# Dead ~~Man~~ Person Switches - with or without trust

**FAO investigative journalists:** If you’re willing to contribute, please let me know, and I can either send you an online survey or we can arrange for a short call. Your anonymity will be protected.

I’ll be asking a series of questions relating to physical risk to investigative journalists or whistleblowers, and how their safety and security is managed.
